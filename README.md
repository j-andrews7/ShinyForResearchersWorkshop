## Overview

### Description

This workshop is designed to introduce participants to the basics of R
Shiny, a web application framework for R. Shiny is a powerful tool that
can be used to create interactive, re-usable, and shareable web
applications that can be used to explore and visualize data, and to
create interactive reports. In particular, this curriculum is geared
towards scientists and bioinformaticians to emphasize how Shiny can
streamline common analyses, figure generation, and empower bench
scientists to explore and interpret their data.

Shiny can be *more* than a way for scientists to dig through data - it
can be a powerful framework for expert bioinformaticians to streamline
figure generation and interpretation they’re doing themselves.

### Pre-requisites

This workshop expects participants to have:

- Basic knowledge of R syntax
- Basic familiarity with the RStudio IDE

### Additional Reading

While it’s not necessary to read these resources before the workshop,
they may be helpful for those interested in learning more about Shiny:

- [Shiny
  Basics](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/)
- [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/)

For more advanced users interested in packaging and sharing their Shiny
apps as an R package, see:

- [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)

### Participation

This workshop is designed as an instructor-led, hybrid-format
experience. The material will remain available online for self-paced
learning indefinitely.

### *R* / *Bioconductor* Packages Used

This workshop utilizes the following packages:

- [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
- [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)
- [PCAtools](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PCAtools.html)
- [shinyjqui](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinyjqui/index.html)
- [shinyBS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinyBS/index.html)

### Workshop Outline

This workshop was designed to be convered in \~2.5-3 hours and includes
4 hands-on modules:

| Activity                                                  | Time |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Core Shiny Concepts                                       | 30m  |
| Basic App Development                                     | 30m  |
| Adding Complexity, Interactivity, and Generalizing an App | 90m  |
| Debugging Shiny, Common Gotchas, and Deployment Options   | 30m  |

### Learning Goals

The goals of this workshop are for participants to:

1.  Recognize how interactive, re-usable tooling can help them work more
    efficiently and effectively.
2.  Understand how such tooling can empower laboratory scientists to
    better understand and investigate their data to derive meaningful
    insights.
3.  Gain a strong foundational knowledge of basic R Shiny functionality
    and development that they can incorporate into their own work.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants should have:

- Basic experience with varied Shiny input/output types.
- The ability to create interactive plots via plotly and allow real-time
  user-customization of plot aesthetics/content.
- An idea as to how to develop an increasingly complex Shiny application
  to run & explore PCA results.
- The ability to package Shiny applications as re-usable R functions.
